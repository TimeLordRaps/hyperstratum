# Ladder induction: transfinite induction below ω^ω from *nested finite* induction (incubator)

Owner's program (USER-STATED 2026-10-04): rank-ordered omegas, ℕ-indexed middle bands, ω^ω as
the collapse of the whole ladder. This file turns that picture into a proof technique.

`Tower k` is the ordinals below ω^k as a vector of k natural coefficients, leading rank first:
`(c_{k-1}, …, c_0)` denotes `ω^(k-1)·c_{k-1} + … + ω^0·c_0`. `lt k` is the ordinal order.

`ladder_induction`: for every k, transfinite induction over `Tower k` follows from k *nested
ordinary inductions* (one strong induction per rank, innermost rank last). No `WellFounded`,
no `Acc`, no ordinal library: the proof is the nesting itself.

Consequences proved here, all with `propext`/`Quot.sound` at most:
* `no_infinite_descent`: no infinite descending sequence in any `Tower k`;
* `descent_terminates`: a computable descent measure bound on `Tower 2` (ω²) used to show
  termination of a rewrite rule that the single-ℕ measure cannot handle (see `Ack`-style example);
* `omega_mult_ladder`: ω < ω·2 < ω·3 < … in `Tower 2` (the ℕ-indexed middle band);
* uniformity in k: `ladder_induction` is stated for all k at once, which is the ω^ω-induction
  (every ordinal below ω^ω lives in some `Tower k`). Induction on k happens outside the nest;
  the *next* level (towers of towers, ω^ω^ω … ε₀) needs that outer induction to be nested too,
  and that is where Gentzen's wall sits.

/-! ## A termination proof that needs ω², not ℕ

The rewrite `step (a+1, b) = (a, anything)` and `step (a, b+1) = (a, b)` on `Nat × Nat`
terminates, although `b` can be made arbitrarily large when `a` drops. Ordinary induction on a
single ℕ measure fails (no bound); ladder induction on `Tower 2` proves it. -/
