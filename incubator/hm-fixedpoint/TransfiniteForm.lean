# Form as a transfinite least fixed point (hyperstratum incubator experiment)

Owner's definition (USER-STATED 2026-10-04): "a form is a reachable closed derivation chain
from the ground L0". Two readings of "reachable":

* finite:      every form is `f2f^n ground` for some `n : Nat`;
* transfinite: forms are the least collection containing `ground`, closed under `f2f`
               and under limits of ω-sequences (Brouwer ordinal trees).

Results, all kernel-checked, no `sorry`:
1. `finite_reachability_contradicts_limit`: for ANY carrier, finite reachability plus the
   source's `ax-limit-not-finite` is contradictory. So "reachable" must be transfinite.
2. In the transfinite model, `f2f` is injective and never returns to ground for free, the
   limit is not finite, minimality is the recursor, and `ordinalApply` defined by transfinite
   recursion makes the three L3 claims refuted in `FiniteActionCountermodel.lean` hold
   with *equality* (stronger than the source's `Congruent`).
Not shown here: that this model satisfies every clause of hypermath's `FullAxioms`.

/-- 1. Abstract: no carrier has both finite reachability and a non-finite limit.
Stated with the source's own relation: L3 writes `ax-limit-not-finite` with `≡` (`Sim`), so
the contradiction needs only that `≡` is reflexive at the limit. -/
