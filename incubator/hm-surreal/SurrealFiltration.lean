# A surreal-normal-form model of hypermath's relation filtration (incubator experiment)

Owner's decision (USER-STATED 2026-10-04): ℕ is definable only at `==`.

Carrier: finite sums `Σ cᵢ·ω^eᵢ` (exponents strictly descending, coefficients nonzero
integers): a fragment of Conway normal form, enough to separate orders of infinity.

* `x == y` : equal.
* `x =~ y` : same leading term (they differ by something of strictly smaller order).
* `x ~~ y` : same leading exponent: same archimedean class, "equatable in continuation".

□ (`f2f`) is doubling. At `~~` it is the identity (every order of infinity is kept); at `==` it
is never the identity off zero and never returns to `ground = 1`. The □-tower `2ⁿ` collapses
to a single point at `~~` and stays injective at `==`, so counting lives only at `==`.
Integer coefficients keep this in Lean core (no Mathlib); averages are in `fold_check.py`.
Not shown: that every clause of hypermath's `FullAxioms` holds here.
