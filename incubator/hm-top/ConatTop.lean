# The ladder and its self-containing top: ℕ inside the conatural numbers (incubator)

`ground or □ of something` has least fixed point ℕ (the `==` ladder) and greatest fixed point
the conatural numbers: ℕ plus one element `top` with `□ top = top`.

Representation (Lean core, no Mathlib): a conatural is a decreasing Bool stream;
`x.f k = true` reads "x has passed rung k". The finite rung `n` has passed exactly k < n.

Kernel-checked here:
* `succ_top`: □ top = top, the top contains itself;
* `rung` embeds the ladder injectively, commuting with □, and □ never lands on ground;
* `top_not_rung`: the top is beyond every rung;
* `extrapolated_top_unique`: anything above every rung IS the top, so the top is fully
  determined by the descriptions of all runs below (owner's "extrapolatable top");
* `finite_or_top` (classical) and `lpo_of_decide_top`: a decision procedure for
  "is x the top?" would decide whether an arbitrary Bool stream is all-false (LPO), i.e. a rung
  cannot, in general, compute whether it is finite or the top.
